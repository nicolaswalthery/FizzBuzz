# FizzBuzz in C with a bit of C++

What does it do ?
It is a simple program that can play Fizz Buzz for how many times you want it to.

That program helps me to learn how to:
1) Use properly If and Else.
2) The For iteration.
3) The "do while", simply use here to ask the user if he want to continue.
4) The challenge here was to create a FizzBuzz program without using any modulo.

This is one of my first program i ever made. :)
